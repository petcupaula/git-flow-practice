# Obi-Wan Kenobi

Wise and skilled Jedi Master who trains Anakin and later Luke Skywalker. 
A member of the Jedi Council and one of the survivors of the Great Jedi Purge, 
Obi-Wan is also a Jedi General during the Clone Wars.

He kills General Grievous and defeated Darth Maul, and his master is Qui-Gon Jinn, 
who is killed by Maul. Obi-Wan is slain in A New Hope by his former apprentice Anakin, 
who had become Darth Vader (a real pain in the ....).
